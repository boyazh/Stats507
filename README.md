This document is the solution to problem set 2, question 3.

In 3a, first, I downloaded on the required files from the website
Then I merged them into one demographic file or dental file using 'append'function
Next I relabeled the columns with proper name and replaced the vlaues in multiple columns to make it eaiser to understand.

Similar in 3b, I first downloaded the dental files and then merged them together using 'append'
Then I replaced the values from the columns to make them easier to read.

in 3c, I counted the total case numbers in the demographic and dental files.
